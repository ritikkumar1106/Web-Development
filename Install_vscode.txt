   - Windows: Run the .exe file and follow the installation wizard.
   - macOS: Open the .dmg file and drag the VS Code icon to the Applications folder.
   - Linux: Run the appropriate command for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the command `sudo dpkg -i <file>.deb` to install the .deb package.
